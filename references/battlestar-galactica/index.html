  <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    Battlestar Galactica is a team game with intrigue, betrayal, and drama. Players are on either the Human's or the Cylon's team, except they don't know who is whom.
  </p>
 
  <h3 id="objective">Objectives</h3>
  <p>
    The human player must travel <strong>8 units of distance</strong> as indicated by the <span class="hovertooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="The destination card shows the number of distance traveled, and the negative consequences for travelling such distance">Destination Cards</span>, then make one more <a href="#jumping">jump</a> to <span class="hovertooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="as indicated by the Kobol card">win the game</span>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The cylons win by preventing the humans from completing their objective. It can be done by:

  <ul>

  <h4>Activating and piloting vipers</h4>
  <p>
    Vipers can be activated from the Command location. When a viper is activated choose one of the 3 options
  </p>
  
  <ul>
     <li>Launch a new viper in region with launch icon</li>
     <li>Move a viper that to adjacent space</li>
     <li>Attack cylon ship in same area</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Only characters with the pilot ability can pilot a viper. The player may move the viper during the movement step, and may move again or attack during the action step. When the fleet jumps, the character is placed in the hangar.
  </p>
  
  <h4 id="damage">Damages</h4>
  <p>
    When a viper is damaged or destroyed, the character is placed in the sick bay if piloted, viper is placed in damaged viper area or removed from game.
  </p>
  <p>
    Destroyed cylon ships are removed from the board, but may return later.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a <span class="hovertooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Raptors are not used in combat or placed on the board except for reserve. They are risked by certain cards for benefits">Raptor</span> is destroyed, it is removed from the game
  </p>
  <p>
    When Basestar or Galactica is damaged, draw appropriate token
  </p>
 
  <p class="toggle-trigger" onclick="showhide(g1)">Galactica Damage token <i class="fas fa-arrow-down"></i></p>
    <ul class="toggle-target" id="g1">
      <li>Damage location - Place on location, character in location is sent to sick bay. Location may be moved to but not activated until repaired. When repaired, shuffle token back into draw pile. Galactica is destroyed when 6 damage tokens are present</li>
      <li>Lost resource - Lose listed resource, remove token from game</li>
    </ul>


  <p class="toggle-trigger" onclick="showhide(g2)">Basestar Damage token <i class="fas fa-arrow-down"></i></p>
  <div class="toggle-target" id="g2">

  </p>
  <ul>
      <li>Critical hit - counts as 2 damage</li>
      <li>Disabled Hangar - may not launch raiders</li>
      <li>Disabled weapons - may not attack Galactica</li>
      <li>Structural damage - All future attack rolls gain plus 2</li>
   </ul>
</div>
    

  <h3 id="cylon">Cylon player</h3>
  <p>
      Cylon players work secretly against the humans to run out a resource, destroy Galactica, or cause an centurion invasion.
  </p>
  <p>
      After distance 4 is jumped, the sleeper agent phase is active. Players receive another loyalty card. Any player with at least one cylon card is a cylon. On some player counts, there is also a sympathizer card.
  </p>
  
  <h4 id="sympathizer">Sympathizer</h4>
  <p>
      Sympathizer sides with the losing team. When one gets this card, immediately reveal it. If at least one resource is in red, the sympathizer is on the human team and is sent to brig. Otherwise, the player becomes a revealed cylon and performs the revealed cylon action.
  </p>
  
  <h4 id="revealedcylon">Revealed cylon</h4>
  <p>
      Revealing yourself as cylon is an action. When that action is taken, perform these steps
  </p>
  
  <ol>
     <li>Discard down to 3 skill cards</li>
     <li>Lose title to next character in line of succession if any</li>
     <li>Move to resurrection ship</li>
     <li>Receive one <span class="hovertooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="These cards are activated by the Caprica location. They are immune to character abilities that affect Crisis cards or skill checks">Super Crisis card</span></li>
     <li>End current turn (do not draw crisis card)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
      On the revealed cylon's future turn, perform these steps. There are no crisis or activate ship steps.
  </p>
  
  <ol>
     <li>Draw any 2 skills</li>
     <li>Move to any cylon location</li>
     <li>Perform location action</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
      The Cylon player can play one skill into each skill check. They cannot use any skill abilities.
  </p>
